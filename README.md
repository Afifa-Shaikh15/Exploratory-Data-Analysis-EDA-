# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA-
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to understand the structure, distribution, relationships, and hidden patterns in the data. It utilizes powerful Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for statistical summaries and visualizations.

Key EDA Steps Covered:
Loading & inspecting the dataset

Generating summary statistics (mean, median, std, etc.)

Checking for missing values

Visualizing data using:

Histograms for distribution

Boxplots for outliers and spread

Correlation heatmap

Pairplot for multi-feature analysis

Computing survival rates by gender and class

Detecting data skewness

Drawing inferences from visual patterns

ðŸ§° Tools & Libraries Used
pandas â€“ for data handling

matplotlib â€“ for plotting basic graphs

seaborn â€“ for statistical visualizations

ðŸŽ¯ Objective
To understand the Titanic dataset deeply before applying any machine learning models. EDA provides insights into feature relevance, relationships, and anomalies which help in data cleaning, feature selection, and improving model accuracy.
